# Bidirectional-Dijkstra-s-Algorithm-
The C code implements the Bidirectional Dijkstra's Algorithm for finding the shortest path from It uses an adjacency list and a min-heap. The bidij function runs two concurrent searches (forward/backward) 3. It terminates when the search frontiers meet or the termination condition best is met, significantly optimizing speed for single-query paths
